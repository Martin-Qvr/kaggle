# Titanic Logistic Regression

The Titanic competition was my first competition on Kaggle.

The goal of the competition was to predict the survival or not of a passenger based on several data including age, classes or gender. Hence, this is a classification problem. 

I did this competition to train on the Logistic Regression which I saw as a part of my regression class at Ã‰cole Polytechnique. Hence I focused mainly on the Logistic Regression model.
